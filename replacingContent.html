            <p >An array of lists is used. Size of the array is equal to the number of vertices. Let the array be array[]. An entry array[i] represents the list of vertices adjacent to the ith vertex. This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. The weights of edges can be represented as lists of pairs. Following is adjacency list representation of the above graph</p>
